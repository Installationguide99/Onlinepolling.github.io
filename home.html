We live in a democracy and voting is one of our fundamental duties as responsible citizens of the country, but nowhere around the country a 100% people come to vote during the elections in their territory (country). There have been many reasons for that which include the rural areas where the influential people keep their men at the polling booths to threaten the common man to vote for them. 
	Net savvy new generation want free voting system. Also the people in metros want a system through which they can vote for their country without traveling. Keeping in mind these situations and to improve the state of democracy in the country Online Polling System can be thought as a solution, in conjunction with the ongoing current manual voting system.
	Online polling system is the system which enables user to vote online.
